# Infrakit

**Infrakit is a lightweight, self-hostable toolkit for essential backend infrastructure, complete with a built-in admin dashboard for TypeScript applications.**

It provides a central SDK to integrate different modules, starting with a powerful in-memory Key-Value store. With adapters for popular web frameworks like Express and Hono, you can add powerful, observable infrastructure components to your existing application in minutes.

-   **Developer-First SDK**: A simple and intuitive TypeScript SDK to interact with your modules.
-   **In-Memory by Default**: Get started instantly with the built-in `KeyValueMemoryAdapter`, perfect for development and caching.

## Monorepo Structure

This project is a monorepo managed by `bun workspaces`. It's organized into the following main directories:

-   `ðŸ“‚ app/`: Contains all the core packages that make up Infrakit.
    -   `sdk`: The main developer-facing SDK (`@infrakit/sdk`).
    -   `modules`: The infrastructure modules, like `@infrakit/modules/kv`.
    -   `adapter`: Framework-specific adapters for the dashboard, like `@infrakit/adapter/express`.
    -   `ui`: The SolidJS frontend application for the dashboard.
-   `ðŸ“‚ examples/`: Example applications demonstrating how to use Infrakit with different frameworks.
-   `ðŸ“‚ website/`: The official documentation and marketing website, built with Astro.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to see Infrakit in action is to run one of the example applications.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/infrakit.git
    cd infrakit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the Express example:**
    ```sh
    bun --cwd ./examples/express dev
    ```

Now, you can visit:
-   `http://localhost:3000` to see the example application running.
-   `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` to see the Infrakit dashboard.
