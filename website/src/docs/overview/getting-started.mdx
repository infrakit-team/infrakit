# Getting started

This guide walks you through installing InfraKit and integrating it into an Express application.

## Installation

Install InfraKit's core SDK along with the modules and adapters you need:

```bash
bun install @infrakit/sdk @infrakit/modules/kv @infrakit/adapter/express express
```

This installs:
- **@infrakit/sdk** - Core InfraKit functionality
- **@infrakit/modules/kv** - Key-value storage module
- **@infrakit/adapter/express** - Express integration
- **express** - Web framework

## Create your first integration

Here's how to add InfraKit to an Express application with in-memory key-value storage:

```ts
// main.ts
import { ExpressAdapter } from "@infrakit/adapter/express";
import { KeyValueMemoryAdapter } from "@infrakit/modules/kv";
import { InfraKit } from "@infrakit/sdk";
import express from "express";

// Initialize InfraKit with the Key-Value module
const infrakit = new InfraKit({
	keyValue:  new KeyValueMemoryAdapter(),
});

// Create the dashboard adapter
const expressAdapter = new ExpressAdapter({
	baseUrl: "/dashboard",
	infrakit,
});

// Use the keyValue client in your application
infrakit.keyValue.set({ key: "greeting", value: "Hello from InfraKit!" });

// Mount the dashboard endpoint
const app = express();
app.use("/dashboard", expressAdapter.endpoint);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Your application is running!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
	console.log("InfraKit Dashboard available at http://localhost:3000/dashboard");
});
```

## What happens here

The code above does three things:

1. **Initializes InfraKit** with an in-memory key-value store that you can use throughout your application
2. **Creates an ExpressAdapter** that generates a dashboard endpoint for monitoring and managing InfraKit modules
3. **Mounts the dashboard** at `/dashboard` so you can access it at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

## Next steps

Now that InfraKit is running, you can explore the dashboard and start using the key-value module in your routes and middleware.
