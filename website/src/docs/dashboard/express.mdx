# Express Dashboard Adapter

The `@infrakit/adapter/express` package allows you to seamlessly integrate the InfraKit dashboard into an existing Express application. It exposes a standard Express router that handles all the necessary API and UI serving for you.

## Installation

First, install the adapter along with Express and the InfraKit SDK.

```bash
bun add @infrakit/adapter/express express @infrakit/sdk @infrakit/modules/kv
```

## Usage

The `ExpressAdapter` is straightforward to use. You initialize it with your `infrakit` instance and a `baseUrl`, and then mount its `endpoint` as middleware in your Express app.

### Complete Example

Here is a complete example demonstrating how to set up an Express server with the InfraKit dashboard.

```ts
// main.ts
import { ExpressAdapter } from "@infrakit/adapter/express";
import { KeyValueMemoryAdapter } from "@infrakit/modules/kv";
import { InfraKit } from "@infrakit/sdk";
import express from "express";

// 1. Initialize InfraKit with your desired modules
const infrakit = new InfraKit({
	keyValue: {
		adapter: new KeyValueMemoryAdapter(),
	},
});

// (Optional) Seed your adapter with some data
infrakit.keyValue.set({ key: "example-key", value: "Hello from Express!" });

// 2. Initialize the ExpressAdapter
const expressAdapter = new ExpressAdapter({
	baseUrl: "/dashboard", // This is the URL where the dashboard will be available
	infrakit,
});

// 3. Create your Express app and mount the dashboard endpoint
const app = express();
app.use("/dashboard", expressAdapter.endpoint);

// Your other application routes
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Your main application is running!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:3000`);
	console.log(`InfraKit Dashboard available at http://localhost:3000/dashboard`);
});
```

### How It Works

-   `baseUrl: "/dashboard"` tells the adapter that all dashboard-related URLs will start with `/dashboard`.
-   `app.use("/dashboard", ...)` mounts the dashboard at that path.
-   The adapter automatically handles serving the dashboard's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and all its internal API routes (like `/dashboard/api/kv/list`).

With this setup, your application runs as usual, and the full InfraKit dashboard becomes available at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
