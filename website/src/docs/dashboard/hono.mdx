# Hono Dashboard Adapter

The `@infrakit/adapter/hono` package provides a simple way to integrate the InfraKit dashboard into a Hono application, making it easy to add observability to your modern, edge-ready projects.

## Installation

First, install the adapter along with Hono and the InfraKit SDK.

```bash
bun add @infrakit/adapter/hono hono @infrakit/sdk @infrakit/modules/kv
```

## Usage

The `HonoAdapter` creates a Hono app instance that you can mount as a route in your main application using `app.route()`.

### Complete Example

Here is a complete example of setting up a Hono server with the InfraKit dashboard.

```ts
// main.ts
import { HonoAdapter } from "@infrakit/adapter/hono";
import { KeyValueMemoryAdapter } from "@infrakit/modules/kv";
import { InfraKit } from "@infrakit/sdk";
import { Hono } from "hono";

// 1. Initialize InfraKit with your desired modules
const infrakit = new InfraKit({
	keyValue:  new KeyValueMemoryAdapter(),
});

// (Optional) Seed your adapter with some data
infrakit.keyValue.set({ key: "example-key", value: "Hello from Hono!" });

// 2. Initialize the HonoAdapter
const honoAdapter = new HonoAdapter({
	baseUrl: "/dashboard", // The URL prefix for the dashboard
	infrakit,
});

// 3. Create your Hono app and mount the dashboard route
const app = new Hono();
app.route("/dashboard", honoAdapter.endpoint);

// Your other application routes
app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Your main application is running!"));

export default app;
```

### How It Works

-   `baseUrl: "/dashboard"` informs the adapter of its public path, ensuring all asset and API links are generated correctly.
-   `app.route("/dashboard", honoAdapter.endpoint)` mounts the entire dashboard, including its UI and API endpoints, under the `/dashboard` path.
-   The adapter handles all incoming requests under `/dashboard` and serves either the dashboard UI or the appropriate API response.

Now, when you run your Hono application, the InfraKit dashboard will be accessible at `/dashboard`.
